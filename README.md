# Traffic System

This is a sample project for the lecture "Software Engineering" at the Johannes Kepler University in Linz.
The main aspect of this project is to show the interaction between different program subdivisions that (altogether) form a traffic (simulation) system. 

The main subsystems (and repo modules) are:
* Traffic control and detection
* Control System
* Traffic Participants
* Road Maintenance

*Note: Those subsystems were predefined in the assignment descriptions and could not be altered by the project members*
